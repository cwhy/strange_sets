Strange sets
====

I am trying to create some datasets
that are hard for general machine learning yet easy to human.

Depends on MLkit:
https://github.com/cwhy/MLkit

## Install MLkit:
```bash
pip install git+git://github.com/cwhy/MLkit.git@master
```

## Install Strange Sets:
```bash
pip install git+git://github.com/cwhy/strange_sets.git@master
```

## Develop Strange Sets:
*
```bash
cd /some/directory
git clone git://github.com/cwhy/strange_sets.git
pip install -e /some/directory/strange_sets
```
* Modify the code
* Pull requests are welcome
