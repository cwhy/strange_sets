Strange sets
====

I am trying to create some hard dataset for general machine learning yet easy to human.

Depends on MLkit:
https://github.com/cwhy/MLkit

## Install MLkit:
```bash
pip install git+git://github.com/cwhy/MLkit.git@master
```

## Install Strange Sets:
```bash
pip install git+git://github.com/cwhy/strange_sets.git@master
```
